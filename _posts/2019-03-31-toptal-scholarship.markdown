Note: My website is currently down. I plan to post this on https://blog.moniqueblake.me, this is a temporary blog.

My name is Monique Blake and I am currently a Backend Software engineer who has also worked in hardware. I code mostly in Python. I also play percussion, guitar, and piano. I speak and write in Mandarin, have work on hardware and jewelry. I am also an artist who works with traditional and digital media. 
 
The ideal work in my life is to create something of immediate and tangible value and purpose. For instance, while living in New York, I worked as a contractor creating a haptic feedback device that would allow the wearer to find the relative location of his comrades through physical sensation (medical device for the blind). This was the sort of work where I thrived as I had to come up with a novel idea to the core needs of of society.
 
I recently discovered the Toptal scholarship from someone I had spoken to at a conference who had insisted that it may be a good opportunity to look into and ultimately pursue. 
 
In the last 6 years, I have taught over 100+ students of various age groups (6-80) in STEM education, ranging from web development to wearables to robotics. I have also done recruitment for STEM education initiatives, like summer programs, to get more high school students into the field.
 
My core values consist of being an advocate for education, learning and synthesizing new hands-on skills, and involving myself in ground level problem-solving using technology. I’ll define each of these relative to my experience, what they mean to me, and finally where I see a scholarship and mentorship helping me in my larger pursuit.
 
I am a first-generation American whose parents and extended family see education as something of an end goal to my upbringing. For as long as I can remember, however, I saw education as a vital mindset. From as early as I could remember, the women in my family would recite a poem to all of the children emphasizing that “learning is better than silver and gold [...] and a good education will never decay.” Education matters in my family since many of the women were unable to receive a college education, and some were unable to complete secondary school due to life factors in their home country. In my immediate family, I am a first-generation female to attend and complete college. In the greater part of my family (that I know of in America, I believe is around 80+ relative), I am the only person with an engineering degree, and the only person in STEM.
 
My relationship with tech and software was initially sparked in middle school where I was inspired by a video game to pursue art, and then share my art online. Soon after, due to my curiosity about how websites were made, I had asked around and someone had pointed me to an all-girls web design message board. So, I signed up. After some time, I had begun to help other members who were struggling with building their website. I also created a new website which had focused on providing stock sites, images, and tutorials. 
 
In retrospect, the first set of people who had believed in me and took the time happened online and during this time. I haven't experienced anything like this since. The people around me in real life didn't quite get what I was doing and thought I was heading down a bad path. Over time I felt pressure and thought I had to buckle down and focus on college and no longer this stuff.
 
When it came time for college, I wanted to be in CS. Admittedly, I was unsure how to accomplish my goals since my parents did not go to college, and I had very little guidance. In the end, I never went with a CS major or minor. I became an Engineering major. 
 
Some of my teachers told me to give up on STEM entirely and considered taking their word for it. I nearly gave up CS entirely if it wasn't for a teacher who I had for assembly language in the prior year who had created an individualized course where I could take the time to ask her any questions I had with programming in a supportive environment. Within a few weeks I realized I knew how to code this entire time. My teacher believed in me this entire time. Then I graduated a few weeks later. If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be where I am today.
 
And as a black woman in tech, I’ve learned empathy begins with listening to what people have to say, and also education. I see that the gap of visibility and equality requires what one might call “disruptors” and “entrepreneurial” advocates. It’s not only vital on principle for me to support tech initiatives to those who are underrepresented in it. I believe that humanity requires all of its voices be a part of its mission if it’s to advance and sustain itself and its environment.
 
This scholarship would allow me time to pursue full-time studies and build impactful software projects. I want to go beyond web development and learn the greater topics of computer science, like machine learning. Since my time in STEM, I have felt like I have been going through it alone, and have a burning desire to go beyond my current skill set and ultimately educate others the variety that exists in computer science. I truly believe that one of the biggest things that would get more underrepresented groups in STEM is more awareness of what is out there and how it could help their immediate community and their individual needs.

With the difficulty I’ve experienced personally in navigating STEM, I see the need to provide help to women and minorities who likewise have to be vigilante in finding resources and avoiding career pitfalls. I want to continue teaching others in STEM so they won’t feel as stuck as I did when I had first pursued it.
